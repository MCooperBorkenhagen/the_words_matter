## Preliminary tuning: 1_harm
The original attempts to tune using the 3k corpus were problematic because too many patterns couldn't be used based on the standard right-side metric.

```{r}
tune_1_harm = read_csv('outputs/tune_1_harm.csv')
```

Let's see the peak of the distribution for train accuracy...

```{r}
tune_1_harm %>% 
  arrange(desc(accuracy_train)) %>% view()
  slice_head(n = 8) %>% 
  select(hidden_units, learning_rate, batch_size, epochs, accuracy_train, accuracy_test, time)

```

### Harm v2

```{r}
tune_1_harm_2 = read_csv('outputs/tune_1_harm_2.csv')
```

Let's see the peak of the distribution for train accuracy...

```{r}
tune_1_harm %>% 
  arrange(desc(accuracy_train)) %>% view()
  slice_head(n = 8) %>% 
  select(hidden_units, learning_rate, batch_size, epochs, accuracy_train, accuracy_test, time)
